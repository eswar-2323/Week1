This project uses a CNN to classify images of plastic waste (e.g., bottles, bags, packaging) into categories, enabling efficient waste management and recycling. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it features image preprocessing, modular design, and metrics like accuracy. Future plans include real-time deployment and IoT integration.
